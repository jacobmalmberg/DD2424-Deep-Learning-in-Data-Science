## Assignment 1.

The instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/jacobmalmberg/DD2424-Deep-Learning-in-Data-Science/blob/master/Assignment%201/Assignment1.pdf) and the full report can be found [here](https://github.com/jacobmalmberg/DD2424-Deep-Learning-in-Data-Science/blob/master/Assignment%201/DD2424_Ass1.pdf).

The first assignment involves training a one layer network with multiple outputs to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. Two variants were implemented, one using cross-entropy loss and one using SVM multi-class loss, The network was optimized to achieve the best performance using decaying learning rate and shuffling of the data.
